SYVD.py

Orginal Author: Seinu#7854

Run pip install -r requirements.txt after changing the working directory to whatever you installed SYVD in.

In my case:

cd C:\Users\Tetra\Documents\Repositories\SYVD

pip install -r requirements.txt

That's all, I really don't like using youtube to mp4's so I use this.

Any questions or bugs, please email Seinuve@gmail.com
